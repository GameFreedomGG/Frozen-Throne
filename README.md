BAD example:</br> when i logged into game and tried casting a spell 4 times arcane concentration would pop and i would try to use another arcane spell but when i used it sometimes it was not 15% critical strike it looked more like 13% to me idk.</br>

GOOD example:</br>
Description: I used Arcane Missles until Clearcasting procced and then used Arcane Blast, but the critical strike appeared to be lower than 15%.</br>
How it works: Arcane Potency critical strike appears to be below 15%.</br>
How it should work: Arcane Potency should be anywhere from 15-30%.</br>
